# SDDM-Monochrome-Red
![screenshot of this theme](https://github.com/camholl/SDDM-Monochrome-Red/blob/main/monochrome/preview.png?raw=true)
a simple red/black theme for sddm, derived from [this monochrome theme by Partik Wyde](https://gitlab.com/pwyde/monochrome-kde)
Buttons are grayed out in the screenshot as it was taken in test mode. They are normally red otherwise.
Just place the "monochrome" directory in /usr/share/sddm/themes/ and you should be good to go after selecting it.
